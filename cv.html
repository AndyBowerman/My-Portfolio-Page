						<h3 class="py-3 border-1 border-bottom">Summary</h3>
						<p class="py-2">I am a self-taught front-end developer with a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have also worked with front end frameworks such as React and Gatsby and I am learning new things everyday. I am looking for a role that will support my development and challenge me to become a better developer. I have many transferrable skills from my current career that will be of value: teamwork, attention to detail and managing client relationships. Above all I will bring a desire to learn.</p>

					<h3 class="py-3 border-1 border-bottom">My Projects</h3>
					<h5 class="pt-2">Gatsby Blog Page</h5>
					<p>Gatsby is an open-source framework based on React. I have created a blog page using Gatsby, GraphQL and Contentful. It allows users to make blog posts via the user-friendly Contentful CMS interface and using the GraphQL API, dynamically creates a new page for each post.</p>
					<h5>React Weather Application</h5>
					<p>A web application which allows users to search for locations globally, displaying the current weather, with the background image changing accordingly.<br> This is my first project working with an external API. I learnt a lot about asynchronous JavaScript and how to work with the JSON data returned including destructuring and displaying the required information for the user.</p>

					<h5 class="pt-2">Aviva – General Insurance</h5>
					<p><u>Distribution Manager (January 2019 – Ongoing)</u></p>
					<p>My role is to manage and develop the relationship between Aviva and its brokers, gaining an understanding of their business and working with them to profitably grow their accounts in a way that is mutually beneficial. Internally we are seen as the voice of our brokers and therefore excellent communication with all stakeholders is imperative. 
					<br>I’ve been lucky enough to collaborate with some excellent teams including pitching for an £800k scheme, handling the full process from identifying the opportunity, understanding what was required and working internally to achieve a proposition that met my brokers needs. I then delivered the pitch and secured the business.</p>
